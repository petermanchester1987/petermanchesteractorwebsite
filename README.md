**This is a static HTML, SCSS and JavaScript website for myself as an actor!**

I decided to showcase some of my HTML, CSS and SASS knowledge with a personal website. 
I previosuly had only used Wordpress, but as this was purely a front end site, 
I decided to build it using vanilla Javascript and host it on Netlify.

It took me just under a week to build and clean up. 
The design was loosely based on other projects I had built (eg. the sliding in menu)
and the vanilla javascript photo sliders.

All in all it looks good, but is a little slow due to the amount of photos and the free hosting option!
